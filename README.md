# Parallelized-Grid-Search-Optimization-for-Water-Quality-Classification
This project aims to classify water potability using machine learning techniques, specifically employing parallelized grid search optimization to enhance model performance. By tuning hyperparameters, we aim to improve the accuracy of our classification model and effectively determine water quality.
